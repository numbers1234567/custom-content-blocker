# Custom Content Blocker

Social media sites will often give us content that we don't want to consume. If a user is just on the website to look at cute cat pictures, they probably don't want to hear about the latest genocide in the Middle East. This is exacerbated by the fact that we can easily be drawn into content which makes us sad or angry, encouraging the company's algorithm to continue feeding us content we don't like. This project intends to give users greater control over the content they see. 

## Automatic Content Blocking

When the user enters a social media site (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook) and the content blocker extension is active, the user can navigate the social media site as normal. However, if there is a post on the site which is similar to manually blocked content, the extension will blur the post, letting the user view it if they click on it.

## Manual Content Blocking

When the user enters a social media site (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook) and the content blocker extension is active, the user can navigate the social media site as normal. However, if there is a post on the site that the user doesn't like, they can manually block the post by right clicking on and then select the "Block" option. This will blur the post, and the post is processed by an internal algorithm to recalculate the user's blocking preferences.
